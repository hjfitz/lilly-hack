# Video Script

## Introduction
Hi, I'm Harry Fitzgerald, a Computer science student at the University of Portsmouth. This is a video to demonstrate the app that I created in the past week, for the recruitment hackathon

## Challenge
The challenge that I decided to answer was the Health Challenge. More specifically, I was inspired by Use Case 2. I wanted to create an app that could help people change their behaviour, because with an illness such as Type 2 Diabetes, It's really important to *maintain* better diet and exercise.

I'm going to start by showing the program at work, and then I'll give a brief overview of the architecture of the program.

## Overview
- Sign up, issue with signing up. log in to premade account
- Show create, explain how it makes the app feel closer to the user and more game like, want to expand on this after the hack if and give rewards for exp
- Show todo, show creation of todo and exp gain
- Show leaderboard and where premade user is
